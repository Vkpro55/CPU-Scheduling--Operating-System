## Key Features
### üñã Blog Section
 Detailed explanations of all major CPU scheduling algorithms, including:
 - First-Come-First-Serve 
 - Shortest Job First
 - Round Robin (RR)
 - Priority Scheduling
 - Preemptive Priority Scheduling
 - Shortest Time Remaining

### üé® Visualization Tool
- Interactive Simulations: Visualize how processes are scheduled for each algorithm.
- Custom Inputs: Users can input their own processes, priorities, burst times, and arrival times to see real-time scheduling outcomes.
- Step-by-Step Execution: Breakdown of the scheduling process with Gantt charts and time analysis.
